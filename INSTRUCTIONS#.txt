Hello, if you are reading this, I am on holiday.

Step 1: Add library

Begin by adding the included "ei-shout-recognition_v5-arduino-1.0.9.zip"
folder to your Arduino IDE library.
In Arduino IDE:
select: Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...
select: "ei-shout-recognition_v5-arduino-1.0.9.zip" from computer

Step 2: Upload code to Arduino

This step will take 10-45mins. Open the Arduino code in IDE from the 
included "timing_maxmsp5" folder. Plug in Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense and 
make sure it is connected correctly. Upload the code to the Arduino. 
The first compile will take really long, however it will only take 1-2mins
any time after that. Continue once upload is completed successfully.

Step 3: Connect MaxMSP

Open the "finalprojvoicerecShoutv2.maxpat" patch. Plug in the Arduino and
make sure the serial is not busy. Press "open", setting should display in 
console. Press "start" to begin. Follow instruction in MaxMSP patch.

Step 4: Next...

If everything works as intended, connect the OUTPUT to the rest of the
project. We can us the KA-WA-BONGA message box to display the final score
and to display messages, you just need to change the message box input.
