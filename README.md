 Create an interactive system that uses machine learning.

## Grade: A1

CS4242 Machine Learning for Interac ve Systems 
Final Project Brief 
The Brief 
Working in groups of 2 create an interac ve system that uses machine learning. Your system 
should demonstrate your ability to choose a relevant supervised machine learning technique 
[classifica on, regression, dynamic me warping], and to train and run a model. 
The system may be a game, a prototype for some commercial applica on, a piece of art, a 
system for performing experimental music with, a system that helps explain ML to a student, 
a cri cal artwork that serves as a provoca on to consider the poten al effects of AI and ML 
in society, etc. 
Your system and the accompanying report should also demonstrate your research and 
explora on of an idea or topic that you are interested in. For example, if you are building a 
system to explore classifica on of hand gestures your report might present your research on 
different approaches to hand gesture recogni on, exis ng commercial approaches, 
par cular difficul es, new developments etc. If you are using faceOsc, your report might 
present your research on the ethics of facial recogni on, the development and deployment 
of this technology etc. 
n.b. students should form groups on Thursday 4th April and begin brainstorming their ideas. 
Students not in a group will be assigned to a group by the module leader, so don’t worry if 
you aren’t sure who to work with. 
Deliverables: Each group must present:  
1. An ini al presenta on of an idea [completed Thursday 4th April. Pdf or ppt emailed to 
REDACTED]  
2. A demo of their project,  a 4 to 6 page report, and 1 minute video demonstra on of 
the project. 
Deadlines:  
Ini al Presenta on: 4th April [prepared and presented in class, rapid fire] 
Demonstra on: Thursday 25th April, 11:00 Room CS1044. 
Report and Video: Submit via brightspace by Wednesday 1st May 11pm. 
Details [please read carefully] 
Demo: Please setup your system in Room CS1044 on Thursday 25th at 11AM. You must be 
ready to present and also to listen to your classmates presenta ons from 11:15. Each group 
will present their work at their desk and answer any ques ons from classmates and faculty. 
The report 
Please use the a ached template [acm_submission_template.doc] for your report. Do not 
alter the layout or fonts. Simply replace the text with your text. Remember to include your 
names at the top. Include diagrams and photos where appropriate. 
Suggested Sec ons for your report include 
1. An introduc on summary of the idea and what you did 
2. The results of your research on your topic e.g. an overview of the history of AI in 
games, a technical descrip on of audio feature extrac on techniques for ML etc. 
3. A descrip on of your development process. 
a. An overview of the system you wanted to build 
b. Choice of algorithm 
c. Training process, training data, 
d. Feature extrac on. How did you choose features? What features? 
e. The development of the output, e.g. choice of sound and video, MAX or 
processing coding. 
4. Conclusion and Future Work 
a. What was learned? 
b. What worked? 
c. What didn’t work as planned and why didn’t it? 
d. Future work: how might this be developed further. 
5. References 
a. Include references for the sources you read for your research. 
b. Include references for the soware you used [e.g. wekinator, processing, 
max] 
c. Your forma ng should match those in the template. I tend to sue Zotero and 
the zotero word plugin to simplify this process. 
Video: Please compress the video to 1080p H.264. I recommend using the free video 
compression soware handbrake (handbrake.fr) with the “Fast 1080p 30” preset. 
Grading Rubric 
In assessing the work I am considering several quali es. Central to my evalua on is whether 
the student has cri cally thought about the algorithm they have chosen, the par cular 
output, and the broader topic etc. 
Secondly I am looking for development and ambi on: Has the group created an ini al simple 
minimum working system and then developed a more complicated version for example. 
Have they tried combining techniques such as DTW and classifica on, etc. 
Thirdly, I want to see that the student has thought carefully about the features they are 
extrac ng from their system and can comment on the success of their model, i.e. has the 
training resulted in a model that is accurate, if not why not, how might it be improved. Why 
were the par cular features chosen? In hindsight might be er features be used. 
Fourthly, I am interested in and will award marks for students’ demonstra on of self
directed development in any related necessary skills such as, electronics, max/msp 
programming, processing, Arduino, mul media development (Audio recording and edi ng, 
video and image etc) 
All of these quali es, or the lack of them, are demonstrated in your wri en report and 
presenta on of the work.
